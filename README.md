# ESPHome integration for mmWave sensors

Collection of header files and esphome yaml configs to integrate some Seeed Studio mmWave sensors into Home Assistant.

Currently the following sensors are partially implemented

* Seeed Studio
  * `MR24HPB1` - 24 GHz Human Stationary Sensor
  * `MR24HPC1` - 24 GHz Human Static Presence Lite
  * `MR60BHA1` - 60 GHz Respiratory Heartbeat Sensor

## Installation

### Files

If you don't bother or use all the supported sensors just copy the `header` and `packages` directories into your Home Assistant `config/esphome` directory.

Otherwise these are the files needed for each sensor:

* `MR24HPB1`
  * Headers
    * headers/mr24hpb1.h
    * headers/mr24hpb1_frame.h
  * Config
    * packages/mr24d.yaml
* `MR24HPC1`
  * Headers
    * headers/mr24hpc1.h
    * headers/mrx_frame.h
  * Config
    * packages/mr24hpc1.yaml
* `MR60BHA1`
  * Headers
    * headers/mr60bha1.h
    * headers/mrx_frame.h
  * Config
    * packages/mr60bha1.yaml

You can change the name of the `headers` directory in home assistant if it doesn't apply to your naming scheme. You can adjust the file locations via substitutions.

```
substitutions:
  header_frame: headers/rx_frame.h
  header_sensor: headers/mr24hpc1.h
```

### Hardware

#### MCU 

The template assumes the use of a `ESP32`. I specifically used the `AZDelivery ESP32 Devkit C`, but any other `ESP32` and `ESP8266` should work I guess. But I have not tested this.

#### Wiring

The template assumes the following wiring:

| MCU              | mmWave Sensor |
|------------------|---------------|
| 5V               | 5V            |
| GND              | GND           |
| GPIO16 (UART RX) | TX            |
| GPIO17 (UART TX) | RX            |

The uart pins can be changed in the ESPHome yaml via substitutions

```
substitutions:
  uart_rx_pin: "16"
  uart_tx_pin: "17"
```

### ESPHome Device

Take a look at the yaml files in the `examples` directory, these should give you a basic understanding of what to do when you create a new device in ESPHome.

Basically the section `substitutions` and `packages` are relevant. When you create a new device the other user relevant section will be generated by ESPHome, the before mentions sections need to be added from the provided example yaml files.

## Supported Functions

The `MR24HPC1` and `MR60BHA1` sensor also support multiple inputs to reset, change operation modes and query specific sensor states.

| radar out of bounds |         |        | x      | measurement (0: out of range, 1: within range)                            |

## Contributing

Since C++ is not my strongest of languages and this is my first implementation which is interacting with ESPHome, Home Assistant and the uart protocol in general, there are probably a lot of things that can be done easier or cleaner.
